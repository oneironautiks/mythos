      As a species, our singularly most defining characteristic, arguably the quintessential human feature has always been that of our capacity for creativity.
      And for the relatively short amount of time we've been around here, we've gotten pretty good at it, to say the least.
      So good that we have things, like, oh, you know, just society and all.
      Civilization, dogs, airplanes, a few lunar landings under our belt, a near-infinite supply of the best and worst cat memes and all in between, not to mention the very 
      screen you're reading this all on right now are just a few examples.
      Everything we have, nearly even just about everything we are, all necessarily started off as a story in someone's (or many someones) mind, and while we may still be quite a ways away from 
      wherever we've been trying to get to for quite a while now, if it weren't for the stories we've carried with us through history, we'd be absolutely nowhere at all. 
      Without stories, we would never have come to "wake up" as a species, to not just be something but also to be aware of being a something.
      Now arguably we might still be somewhat half-asleep, stumbling around a bit blindly and sometimes quite violently, but still quite an impressive result of letting stardust just
      sit around and brew for a few billion years. 
      If we are to be a way for the universe to know itself, then sharing and spreading our stories can be a way of showing thanks for our part in that knowing, by preserving it indefinitely.
      The sake of our future depends upon remembering our past; to that end, this website's intention is to be a reminder.
